        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>SEGA Master System (also known as Mark III in Japan) is the second home video game console made by Sega. In North America, it was released a year after NES and directly competed with it. However, the sales of the system were significantly lower than of NES. It was not successful in Japan and North America but gained some popularity in PAL regions. In Brazil, Master System was a huge success and has not been discontinued until 2018 making it the console with the most significant lifespan.<br/>
                The Master System gamepad included a D-pad and two face buttons. The console used two main formats of data storage: game cartridges and more affordable Sega Cards (or Mark III My Card in Japan). Additionally, the system could play most of the games from previous Sega console – SG-1000. The console’s success in PAL regions led to Sega porting some of their games from their next console, Mega Drive (Genesis in North America) onto the Master System.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Sega Genesis (known as Sega Mega Drive outside North America) is Sega’s third home video game console, a successor to Sega Master System. The console was a success for Sega and became the company’s best-selling console of all-time with more than 30 million units sold worldwide. It competed with NES, TurboGrafx-16 and, later, SNES. The console is notable for being the origin platform for Sega’s flagship franchise – Sonic The Hedgehog. The original trilogy of games was actively used in the Genesis promotion and played an essential role in the console’s success.<br/> 
                Throughout its lifespan, Genesis received several revisions. The most notable of them is 1993 Genesis (without Sega prefix) or Mega Drive 2 outside North America. This model brought the 6-button controller instead of the original 3-button controller. Throughout its lifespan, two significant add-ons were released for the system: Sega CD and Sega 32X. The first one let Genesis read data from CD and the second one drastically increased the hardware power of the console.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>SEGA Saturn is the fourth home video game console made by Sega and a successor to Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. Initially, the system’s focus was on recreating the arcade experience at home. This decision was partially made because of the success of Sega’s arcade division. Saturn got several well-received ports of such arcade hits as Virtua Fighter and Daytona USA. The Saturn’s library is also notable for several unique critically acclaimed projects such as Shining Force 3, Nights into Dreams, Guardian Heroes and Panzer Dragoon series among others.<br/> 
                The gamepad of Sega Saturn is very reminiscent to that of Genesis but has slightly different design and two additional shoulder buttons. The console was a commercial failure for the company due to its high price tag, lack of third-party support, technical specifications that made programming for the system intense and challenging competition from Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64.</p>

        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>SEGA CD (also known as Mega-CD in some regions) is the first add-on for Sega’s Genesis/Mega Drive console. The add-on improved the hardware of the console and allowed it to read CDs. The CD format offered more than 300 times more storage than standard Genesis cartridges which made possible to include Full Motion Video (FMV) cutscenes in the games as well as overall more content. The addon required a separate power source and attached to the side of the Genesis. The Genesis cartridges could still be played without detaching the addon.<br/> 
                Aside from games on optical disks, Sega CD could play audio CD as well CD+G format. The system is considered to be unsuccessful. The game library of Sega CD was criticized for a large number of badly-received FMV-games and lack of original titles. However, the system got several acclaimed titles such as Sonic CD, Silpheed and Lunar series.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>SEGA 32X is the second add-on for Sega’s Genesis/Mega Drive console. It was released later in the Genesis’ lifespan. It attached to the console’s cartridge slot, required separate power supply, and noticeably increased the console performance, allowing it to play 32-bit games that were exclusive to the add-on. The 32X was a huge commercial failure for the company and was criticized for its small game library, and confusing market timing (by the time of the system release, the next Sega console, Saturn, was already available in Japan).<br/> 
                Only 40 games were released for the system, six of which required both 32X and the other Genesis add-on, Sega CD. The most well-received and popular games for the console were Knuckles’ Chaotix and ports of Mortal Combat II, DOOM and NBA Jam. The games that required Sega CD were mostly FMV games that were also received negatively by players and critics alike.</p>

            <h2>Sega Dreamcast</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Dreamcast is the fifth and the last home video game console made by Sega. It was released only four years after the launch of the previous Sega console, Saturn. The system was more affordable than its predecessor, had a unique gamepad that drastically differed from other consoles’ controllers and offered numerous features that were considered to be ahead of its time. It became the first console with a pre-build modem and supported online multiplayer in certain titles such as Phantasy Star Online. The Dreamcast controller included an analog stick, a D-pad, four face buttons, and two analog triggers.<br/>
                Its most notable feature was the Visual Memory Unit that could be inserted in the gamepad and served as a small additional monochrome screen and a memory card. Additionally, the VMU had its control elements and could pay some mini-games depending on which game files it had. The game library of Dreamcast is frequently praised for numerous critically-acclaimed installments in Sega’s classic game series, as well as its unique and innovative titles from both Sega and third-party developers.</p>
